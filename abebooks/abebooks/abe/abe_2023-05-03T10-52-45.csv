The activity was born in 1975 with a strong passion for ancient books and handicrafts that prompted the two owners to throw themselves in the niche market of restoration and bookbinding of ancient books. It is a world-wide trade, not a bookstore, nor a restorer for the truth, but an art binder because everything is born from the outside and creativity of the Master and art is at the heart of everything.
In practice, the Charta seeks out old books, possibly in bad or semi-destroyed ways, and then brings them back to life through a meticulous artisanal binding work
Everything is born of the passion for books, there is no manual on which to study the binding technique. The Master is self-taught, a bit antiquarian, a bit restorer; He loves to restore old books with ad hoc covers made by him, experimenting from time to time with new ideas and adding new materials to his creations.
With regard to times, there is no standard length for all volumes. Two phases can be mentioned: the first, which includes the study and the creation of the binding, can take months (once for a copy signed by Hemingway it took 2 years), the Second is the material realization of the binding and it lasts for about 6 hours. The favorite material for binding is leather, sometimes with the addition of metal details, always found by Venetian suppliers and craftsmen.
The Charta catalog includes no more than 300 volumes, all unique creations that are difficult to repeat. It is possible to find mostly illustrated and classic books of the 1900s, but also books related to gothic and esotericism, almost always in the original language.

Con la creazione di relazioni con i più importanti Istituti, Biblioteche, Archivi, Musei, Gallerie, editori di tutto il mondo, la libreria del Centro Di divenne così un importante centro di distribuzione e vendita di volumi d'arte, tanto che il 'New York Times' la definì una delle quattro più importanti librerie d'arte al mondo. Vi si potevano trovare dall'ultimo catalogo di mostra del MOMA a quello di una piccola galleria d'arte italiana. In un universo ante-internet questo significava per molti trovare ad ogni visita una scelta vasta ed eccitante, un vero ""scrigno di tesori"". L'attività libreria del Centro Di si è interrotta negli anni novanta, ma alla morte di Alessandra Marchi, avvenuta nel febbraio 2015, l'archivio del Centro Di conteneva ancora circa 30.000 titoli che includono pubblicazioni da tutto il mondo con una forte prevalenza di libri e cataloghi di mostre sull'arte del Novecento, fra cui importanti cataloghi e libri d'artista degli anni 60/70. L'archivio copre argomenti di storia dell'arte, architettura, arti decorative, e include libri d'artista, cataloghi di mostre, monografie, cataloghi d'aste, riviste. 

Centro Di was founded in Florence by Ferruccio and Alessandra Marchi at the end on the 1960s with the dual role of avantgarde publishing house and bookshop/documentation centre for the arts (hence the name Centro Documentazione Internazionale); Centro Di soon became a meeting place for those scholars, artists, students, lovers of the arts who could find -in the minimalist designed bookshop in the basement of Palazzo Torrigiani in the Florentine Piazza de' Mozzi -all sorts of publications related to the arts, coming from museums, galleries, publishers world wide, and almost impossible to be found anywhere else in Italy. At the end of the 1970s, the New York Times described Centro Di as one of the four best art bookshops in the world. The bookselling activity of Centro Di ended in the 1990s (the publishing house is still active today), but at the time of Alessandra Marchi's passing in 2015, the Centro Di archive still contained over 25.000 titles encompassing a range of sectors and subject areas, from art history to architecture, design, decorative arts, contemporary art etc, published in Italy and abroad up to the 1990s, with an important collection of exhibition catalogues and rare artists books from the 60s and 70s.

Il negozio si trova nella stessa strada della sede iniziale, aperta nel settembre 2014. Dopo una intensa progettazione e attività di restauro il locale è stato riaperto riacquistando l'antico splendore l'arredamento in stile liberty, il lucernario e riportando alla luce il vecchio forno nel seminterrato, sede un tempo del laboratorio/pasticceria. Tra migliaia di volumi usati e antichi, cerchiamo di dare valore principalmente alla qualità delle edizioni fuori catalogo. Vogliamo tuttavia dare a tutti la possibilità di acquistare e leggere nel nostro negozio, dunque abbiamo molti titoli a buon mercato anche di testi più comuni. La passione tuttavia ci spinge ad acquistare e proporre più volentieri libri antichi e rari. Tutti i volumi sono rigorosamente schedati e fotografati. Infine d'estate apriamo un alpeggio a 1200 metri di altitudine in cui abbiniamo la vendita dei libri usati a proposte gastronomiche di prodotti esclusivamente locali e biologici: vini, marmellate, salumi e formaggi. Un esperienza davvero particolare. Siamo molto attivi sul fronte culturale, organizzando conferenze, presentazioni, reading e saltuariamente mostre e concerti.

After graduating in aesthetics in Bologna with Luciano Anceschi, he spent some years in Milan at the Garzanti publishing house and then decided to start a completely new activity within the rare books business. The great number of catalogues he has produced over the years testify to his competence and passion for the old book, as well as to the richness and variety of the works offered. 
In 1996, Alberto is joined in the activity by his son Fabrizio, who, after graduating in Bologna with the art historian Anna Ottani Cavina, began a long and exciting apprenticeship in the world of antiquarian books. 
A distinctive mark of the Libreria Alberto Govi is the philological rigor with which all books (regardless of their value) are examined before being offered to customers. The bibliographical care applied to both the collation and physical analysis of the book, as well as to the research of scientific documentation, that can help to understand the historical significance of a work, is another important criterion of dealing with rare books 
Our main fields of interest are manuscripts (Alberto is an expert codicologist and has improved his knowledge at the Rare Book School of Charlottesville, Virginia), incunabula and 16th century books. 
A thorough understanding of classical languages (particularly Latin) and of the main languages of Western culture (English, French, Spanish and German) allows us to deal with books and to utilise the scientific publications printed in these languages.
Fabrizio has also deepened his knowledge in the field of antiquarian books, attending courses at the École de l Institut d Histoire du Livre of Lyon, concerning physical bibliography and printing types.
Fabrizio has been for several years treasurer of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Italy and is now its president.
The Libreria Alberto Govi generally publishes a printed catalogue every year.",8910261,https://www.abebooks.com/libreria-alberto-govi-f-govi-sas/8910261/sf,https://pictures.abebooks.com/storefront/8910261/VendorStoreFront.jpg,{}

La percezione del progressivo impoverimento delle proposte culturali hanno spinto due librai - Danilo Galli e Giovanni Moscati - e un'archivista - Paola Franceschini - a creare un'ampia libreria che offrisse l'opportunità di trovare, tra gli oltre ventimila titoli, opere dei generi più diversi: dall'usato a buon prezzo alla rarità per l'amatore.

Riproporre opere dimenticate dall'editoria, talvolta ristamparle, e far sì che possano rinascere a nuova vita è l'obbiettivo che si sono prefissi perché un buon libro può invecchiare ma non morire.

USA,Churchill Book Collector ABAA/ILAB/IOBA,"San Diego, CA, U.S.A.",,25:10:2006,5,"We specialize in books and other published works by and about Sir Winston Churchill.  His official biographer, Sir Martin Gilbert rightly called Churchill's long life ""remarkable and versatile"".  Statesman, soldier, war correspondent, painter - Churchill was many things, but perhaps above all a master wordsmith.  He published 58 books, 260 pamphlets, and more than 840 feature articles.  His speeches fill 9,000 pages.  He won the Nobel Prize in Literature.  And writing was his part-time job.  Our job is to help Churchill's words find your shelves.  Our extensive inventory represents decades of experience collecting Churchill.  Our diverse offerings include not only rare first editions and inscribed works, but also sound and affordable reading copies.  Our descriptions are reliably detailed and accurate, always accompanied by images of the actual item offered.  Please note that we are able to help assemble full collections of Churchill's works and commission exceptional quality fine bindings.

Our History: 

Coas Books was founded in 1983 by archaeologist Pat Beckett. It started out as an archaeological publishing company specializing in anthropology books. As Pat's vast collection of books continued to grow, he purchased a local paperback exchange, and with that Coas Books was born. The name Coas has its roots in archaeology, coming from the Nahuatl term  coa    meaning digging stick  , and the acronym for ""Center of Anthropological Studies"". Today, Coas Books is run and operated by Mike and Veronica Beckett as they continue to proudly serve the community in the heart of Las Cruces.

Alasdair is a native of Edinburgh, Scotland, with a colorful mercantile family history which saw the salvage of shipwrecks off the English coast, as well as the transportation  of a  revolutionary relative to Australia in the eighteenth century. When not swashbuckling through the world of amateur electronics and computers as a lad, he scared himself silly with science-fiction, ghost stories and gothic novels. Alasdair grew up in the house of his grandparents, classical scholars, whose rooms were crammed with books of all sorts. His partner, Alexandra, is a third-generation book dealer, whose appreciation of the well-printed page stems from the clackety-clack of the smallest of small-press workshops operating from the back room of the family barn.  She is a graduate in history and art history from Bowdoin College, with a particular interest in the Far East and the China trade, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, and the British Arts & Crafts Movement.  She also spent some years working for a nationally known early-American antiques dealer. They now make their home in historic Newburyport, on the Massachusetts coast.

But, he did know one thing.  He loved history and he loved books. 

That small shop was the beginning of Elder's Bookstore, one of the landmarks of Tennessee and the South.  Today, in its 75th year, Elder's Bookstore is the oldest general bookstore in continuous operation in Nashville. 

If you have not visited our store, we invite you to stop in while you are in Nashville and browse.  You may never want to leave our world of books. 

Charles Elder was the dean of Nashville booksellers until his retirement at the age of 93.  He started our store in the depths of the Great Depression.  Nationally known as an expert on ephemera and manuscripts, he was also widely versed in maps and early Tennessee history.  He was a winner of the Frances Neel Cheney Award by the Tennessee Library Association and was honored by the Tennessee Booksellers Convention in 1990 for his lifetime of service to the industry.  Since his retirement, his son Randy Elder has become owner and operator of the business. 

From his earliest days, Randy Elder has been around books, reading them, and then helping his father buy and sell them.  He started as a partner and sales manager and is now owner.  He has been responsible for the store's rise to the status of foremost re-publisher of early Tennessee and Nashville history books.  Under his direction, Elder's has become one of the premier dealers in 20th century literature - particularly Southern Literature - in the United States.

Our focus is on editions of aesthetic merit, whether because of their bindings, typography, plates, or even dust-jacket art. From the hand-press period, we favor emblem books, poetry and prose; titles drawn from the landmark exhibition, Printing & the Mind of Man; and works on travel, the classical world, and landscape design, many with hand-colored engravings and maps.  Our nineteenth-century holdings include early Baedekers and Americana and plate books with all genres and styles of illustration.

VITA SINE LIBRIS MORS EST! Hello to all bibliophiles and bibliomaniacs from a bibliopole with a bibliotheca where an abundance of quality tries to make up for lack of quantity - if compared with that of Amazon et al. 
Literature is an art and that is why I have incorporated a bookstore into my main business, custom framing. While I thoroughly enjoy this business, my first love always was and always will be books. Most recent feedback: 1. The books are in even better condition than described - they are simply perfect. 2. The books were clearly packed with extreme care. Simply put--these books were packed with more care than anything I have received in the mail for as long as I can remember. And to top it off, they were shrink-wrapped!
Some previous feedback: 1. I believe it was the best packaged book I have ever seen."" 
2. ""You are the champion of perfect book-mailers!  How wonderfully you protected the book by bubble wrap and you reinforced the envelope so well with tape.  The book is in pristine condition.  Thank you so much for doing such a beautiful job"".
3."" Just received my copy of ""Brighty of the Grand Canyon"". Just as described (perfect really) and your processing time is totally amazing. Thank you for such a wonderful job. I am impressed and will gladly do business with you again as need and money allow"".
4."" I wanted you to know how impressed I was by the packaging as well! The book was so well protected I thought I had accidentally received a hardback copy! 5. I recently purchased a first edition book from you (Herbs and Apples), and I just want to thank you for your prompt service, careful packaging and reasonable price. Also, your description of the book was detailed and accurate, so the book is as I expected.
Thank you for visiting my virtual store. If you're in the neighborhood - You All Come - as they say around here!

USA,JAC Books,"Cortland, NY, U.S.A.", +1 607-216-9645,11:04:2018,5,"ABOUT THE STORE:  I am not a professional bookseller.  I have been collecting books for over 60 years but age, finances, and related issues now demand that I begin making the books available to others who can appreciate them.  
To begin, I've been listing books in the horror, SF, fantasy, and mystery categories.  Many of these books were purchased from dealers such as Gerry de la Ree and Robert Weinberg or directly from publishers such as Don Grant and Cemetery Dance.  I was an early enthusiast of the Lovecraft group of writers (I was on my way to visit August Derleth in early July of 1971 when I heard that he had just died).   I m working on listing more books in these fields, getting photos on line, etc.   
In the future I hope to include books on geology, caves, environment, science, art, general literature and fiction in addition to topographic maps, magazines, some original art, and more.  


SHIPPING:  For standard shipping in the U.S. via USPS Media Mail I ask $5.00 for one book and $1.00 for one or more additional books in that shipment.  You will be notified if extra shipping costs are needed (for Priority mail, International shipments, heavy or oversized books, or special handling as requested by the buyer).  I will pay for insurance for more valuable books.  Reduced shipping costs are available for multiple book orders or small, light-weight items such as pocketbooks. 

USPS PRIORITY shipping in the U.S. is available but the cost varies depending on weight and destination.  USPS charges for nearby Priority shipping are in the $10-16 range for one book (if shipping weight is under 4 pounds), and increases for more distant locations.  Wish I could be more specific. Add what you think is fair and I will let you know if additional shipping will be needed.  

INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: BAD NEWS. international shipping costs are so inconsistent and confusing that I'm unable to give an estimate.  Shipping prices have been generally rising since the Covid scare.  The USPS tells me these trends will continue.  Check with the U.S. Postal System website to get a better estimate of shipping.

Mecca Books (www.meccabooks.com)  was formed to provide today s generation of knowledge seekers a place where they can get authentic Islamic books. We make sure that each and every book, CD, and DVD carried in our store is thoroughly examined for its authenticity. We only work with the most reputable publishers, who in turn work with notable scholars.
 
Most prominent Islamic book stores advertise all titles, regardless of validity. Customers purchase a title only to realize later that the author belongs to one of the deviant groups or the context of the book is not what they expected.

We understand that in this age of media, it is difficult to distinguish genuine titles. Therefore, we want our customers to be rest assured that any purchase they make from our website is guaranteed for its authenticity.

We are increasing our inventory daily, so please check back often for new arrivals. We ask for your feedback in any new suggestions you may have for titles that you would like us to carry.

Whether you re looking for a rare piece for your collection or a gift for someone else s, HistoryAtHomeAtlanta has got you covered! 

I started this shop after years spent collecting. I d collect anything: old movie posters, political signs, books, coins, art, and many other things. I loved finding creative ways to display my collections and it was exciting to thrill friends and guests with a new piece I d only recently uncovered. That is how I came up with the idea for the shop. HistoryAtHomeAtlanta is a specially curated shop of antique and vintage items, fine art, historical items, Hollywood Golden Age collectibles, and rare and signed books. Many of these pieces fit squarely in a historical context - and I ll be sure to include that information when applicable.

Specifically, we enumerate defects, even small ones; we never say ""possibly""  or "" may have"" : we look at the book and tell you what we see! That s simple professionalism.
              
Our history: founded in 1971 by Wayne Somers, a former college library bibliographer, Hammer Mountain Book Halls began as a catalogue business specializing in out-of-print scholarly books. We chose the name for euphony and because we occupied the second-highest point in the county, the top of a 1,200 foot hill. Since 1981, we've also operated ""W. Somers, Bookseller,"" a retail book shop with a constantly changing general stock of books not listed on the Internet. It's open Monday-Friday, 11-5, and Saturday, 10-5; browsers are welcome. We've been members of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of American since 1977. We're also the publisher and sole source of the invaluable ""Bibliography Finder for American Authors,"" by Wayne Somers and Ilse Pinkus, which you can buy for a pittance through Advanced Book Exchange.
Farther down this page you will find two entirely separate systems of dividing our books by subject. The first, called ""Catalogues"", was created and is maintained by us. The second, listed under ""Browse Hammer Mountain Book Halls,"" is called ""Categories.""  It was created by ABE using computer programs which produce many stunning errors. We do not recommend using the Categories.

Recent Feedback from a Customer:  The book that I ordered from you, arrived Friday in perfect condition.  I was pleasantly surprised at how carefully packed it was.  I have ordered a lot of books through Abe Books from various vendors, and often enough the used book arrives badly packaged and with the packaging damaged, so that I have no idea what the original condition of the book was before it was shipped.  This was not the case with the book I ordered from you.  I was also surprised at how quickly it came 
I am well pleased and hope to do business with you again in the future.


At Glenn David Books we specialize in previously owned books.

Some of the (100+ ) catalog lists we carry include : American History, Anthropology, Classic Children's Books, Evolution /Natural History, Psychology & Sociology, Military History, Nature & the Natural World, Religion /Spirituality/Theology, and Young Readers Books.    
   I have many interests in many different subjects. From Classic Childrens Books to Military History, from Anthropology to Religion & Theology.  The books to list keep on growing.
   If you have an interest in a particular line of study please send me your list.  I enjoy keeping an eye open for that difficult book.

USA,French and European Publications Inc,"New York, NY, U.S.A.",,13:11:2019,4,"In 1935, Isaac Molho and partners opened Librairie de France (French & European Publications Inc.) at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. During WWII the shop served as an important voice of the oppressed people of Nazi-occupied France. It featured the books of French authors who had fled their country after the German invasion. The most famous of these books would have to be The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

In October of 1944 (after the Allied liberation of France) the exiled French writer JACQUES MARITAIN voiced his great appreciation for Librairie de France:

I congratulate the effort the Librairie de France made to help maintain French culture in the New World during the Second World War. In the very dark days of 1940, when disaster overwhelmed hearts, when the surrender accepted by the Vichy government announced publicly that France was defeated, and American schools diverted the study of the French language in favor of Spanish the launch in New York [of a publisher] in French editions appeared foolish. Aware of their moral responsibilities towards France, the directors of the Librairie de France had enough energy and ambition to take this initiative. They began their task as editors in the Autumn of 1940.

In the free land of the United States, the works of French expression could thus continue to appear, and try to give a voice to the gagged people of France. Through the walls of [German] censorship, French authors could continue to appear in spirit and in reality along with a few books passed as contraband, and a day will come when the French people will read [the books] that were written for them. [It would be many months before book publishing and book sales returned to the newly-liberated French]

[The directors of Librairie de France] could also continue to give witness [to work written from within occupied France]. No longer receiving anything from France, the general public was for a moment disconcerted. And all those in the New World who cherish French language and thought could continue to hear the voices of the oppressed writers of France who did their best during the silence imposed by force. The liberation of the country will finally allow them to make known in France and the world the works prepared during four years of darkness or heroically published as clandestine editions.

Since 1940 the Librairie de France has been a considerable achievement, which proclaims both the vitality of French culture in this country and the depth of the Franco-American friendship, and it served usefully this culture and friendship. I would like to express to the Librairie de France the recognition of a French writer who found with her the most dedicated cooperation in everything he undertook to serve on this hospitable land the cause of France and freedom.

The Librairie de France brick-and-mortar bookstore closed its doors in 2009, but they still run a mail-order business (French & European Publications Inc.) selling thousands of leftover unused rare books.

USA,Encanto Books,"Santa Monica, CA, U.S.A.",,29:10:2021,4,"Encanto Books (pronunciation: /en-kan-toh/) represents a collection of approx-imately 5,000 first edition books acquired over a period of forty years. The collection is comprised primarily of hardcover fiction, but includes a sizable number of 1950 s and 1960 s pulp paperback publications as well. Spanning a timeframe from the 1930 s Depression era all the way up to the present day, the collection has something of interest for virtually any serious antiquarian.

A majority of the books for sale are true first editions, first printings; tantalizing, many of these are signed editions, too.  While the collection has great depth and scope overall, there is no denying that our greatest interest was reserved for finding books of a particular genre of fiction: mysteries.

Encanto Books has succeeded in collecting virtually the entire output from some of the greatest American mystery writers ever.

USA,"Archer's Used and Rare Books, Inc.","Kent, OH, U.S.A.",,05:08:1998,5," I have been a bookseller since 1986 and closed my shop in 2001 to concentrate on mail order, appraisals, and do some writing. My stock includes a large collection of books on Baseball as well as True Crime, Ohioana, Botany, and Music.

My personal book interests include H.L. Mencken, P.G. Wodehouse, Charles Darwin, Jim Tully, travel, baseball, especially the Negro Leagues, botany, true crime, and music.

My books. In 1992 a man walked into my bookshop in Kent, Ohio, and asked for a copy of The Bruiser by Jim Tully. I'd never heard of the book or its author despite the fact that many credited Tully with being the father of hard-boiled fiction. Worse, Tully began writing in Kent in the early 20th century. Nineteen years later, Mark Dawidziak and I completed Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler. Ken Burns contributed a foreword.We've also written introductions to reissues of four of Tully's books: Beggars of Life, The Bruiser (Fwd by Gerald Early), Circus Parade (Fwd by Harvey Pekar), and Shanty Irish (Fwd by John Sayles).

One of many delays was another book: Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues by Frazier Robinson w/ Paul Bauer. Fwd. Buck O'Neil. Intro. Gerald Early. Frazier caught, among others, Satchel Paige and Leon Day. When he wasn't playing baseball, he was hitting the jazz clubs of KC, NY, and Baltimore where he saw Nat King Cole, Charlie Parker, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, and others. Redd Foxx was one of his bar-hopping buddies. Frazier loved baseball and jazz.

Currently available:

Circus Parade (Foreword by Harvey Pekar). Tully's gritty memoir of carny and circus life.

Beggars of Life . His breakthrough autobiography about his life as a road kid.

Shanty Irish (Foreword by John Sayles). Tully's autobiographical novel about his childhood.

The Bruiser (Foreword by Gerald Early). Tully's classic novel of the ring.

          34236",,04:05:1997,4,"Incorporated in 1980, A. Parker's Books has been located in downtown Sarasota, Florida for over thirty years. We have consistently offered one of the finest selections of rare and antiquarian books in the Southeast and provide Library Design and Collection Development among our services.  Our knowledgeable staff and our high level of integrity are demonstrated and monitored by our professional memberships in the Florida Antiquarian Booksellers Association (FABA), Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA), and International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB).

More than a decade ago, we merged our stock with a neighboring bookstore, Book Bazaar, Inc. Our Sarasota storefront has since housed two distinct shops; A. Parker's Books, Inc., continues to specialize in antiquarian, rare and finely bound books and maintains a rare book room which is the highlight of many visits to the store, while Book Bazaar, Inc., fills the majority of the space with an array of used, out-of-print and scholarly books. Together, we aspire to offer something for everyone, from the avid reader to the antiquarian collector. Our commitment to customer service and variety is demonstrated by repeat visits from tourists, both foreign and domestic, as well as the hours many local residents spend among our stacks.

After merging with Book Bazaar, we opened a new shop in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, incorporated as Crescent City Books, Inc. Later a fourth store, Commonwealth Books, Inc. was opened in Boston, Massachusetts on the Boston Common. This store has recently moved to the Downtown Crossing area. Each has its own specialties and atmosphere while continuing the traditions of maintaining friendly and knowledgeable staff and providing a wide variety of out-of-print, scholarly, rare and antiquarian books. It is not surprising that all have become favorites in their own communities.

A fifth store, Commonwealth Books II, is now open in the historic Old South Meeting House on Boston's Freedom Trail and is a welcome addition to our family.

With the addition of a new store, we now serve five communities of book enthusiasts. With the Internet, we serve an ever expanding global community. While Internet sales can never replace the experience of stepping into a shop brimming with wonderful old books, it can connect booklovers to items they might not have otherwise found. It is our goal to provide a pleasant browsing or buying experience to all of our visitors, both physical and virtual. We hope this web site helps to achieve that goal and that you enjoy your visit here. We also hope that if you find yourself in Sarasota, New Orleans, or Boston, you will stop in and spend some time with our books.  If none of these cities is in your itinerary, we also exhibit at several Book and Antique Shows and Fairs throughout the year.  Please send us an email; we'll gladly let you know our schedule.

          01810",,12:08:2004,4,"Andover Books and Antiquities presents Basileia Books, a collection of rare and out-of-print books in religion and the humanities. The core areas are FOUNDATIONS IN DIVINITY and FAITH AND PRACTICE, forming a structure that imitates a classical curriculum for Christian ministry. The collection focuses on Christianity and Judaism, and includes the comparative study of these two with other religious traditions. The cognate areas are ARTS AND LETTERS and RELIGION AND SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY. Here the collection extends into the breadth of subjects in the arts and humanities. The interpretive scheme demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge and illustrates the suffusion of belief systems in all areas of human endeavor. **Basileia Books strives to meet the needs and interests of book collectors, scholars, librarians, and leaders in religious and community organizations. We provide services in bibliographic research, language translation, and collection development. Catalogues and thematic magazines appear on a regular basis. ** The most recent additions to the collection highlight the Ancient Near East as well as religion in late antiquity. The materials in Egyptology and in gnosticism are particularly significant. **Our newest catalogues juxtapose rare and historic materials with recent scholarly interpretations of the corresponding times. Each historical epoch contains a mutual and dynamic exchange between religion and culture. Here is the sequence for this interdisciplinary approach to Judaism and Christianity: ONE: The Origins of Monotheism and the Development of City States to 600 B.C.E. / TWO: Kingdoms and Empires of the Near East and Mediterranean in the Last Six Centuries Before the Common Era / THREE: The Birth and Growth of the Christian Faith in the First Century of the Common Era / FOUR: Patristic and Rabbinic Developments within the Shifting Political Frontiers of the Second through Sixth Centuries of the Common Era / FIVE: Byzantine and Medieval Civilization from East to West, 600 CE to 1500 CE / SIX: Renaissance Humanism of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries / SEVEN: Reformation of Church and Society in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries / EIGHT: Religion and Revolution in the Eighteenth Century / NINE: Believing and Doubting in the Nineteenth Century / TEN: The Impact of Modernism on Judaism and Christianity, 1900 to 1950 / ELEVEN: Faith in a Secular Age and the Second Half of the Twentieth Century / TWELVE: Ancient Traditions and the Emergence of New Paradigms in the New Millenium.**We present exhibits at academic conferences in North America, providing valuable opportunities for students, teachers and scholars to discover unusual and unfamiliar materials in their particular fields. At the same time, we develop a keener sense of current and developing scholarship. Our conversations with attendees help us to identify priorities for expanding the Basileia collection, and to find specific books that our customers are seeking.

          30031",,26:05:1998,5,"""I have spent many delightful hours poring over the . . . lists of second-hand booksellers. . . . All these are redolent of romance. They are much more entertaining than half the novels that are written."" 
				-W. Somerset Maugham. 


Auldfarran Books has been in business as an antiquarian and secondhand bookseller since 1993 and is a member of the International Association of Online Booksellers.  E-mail is the surest way to get in touch with us.

Our listed first editions are the first printings unless otherwise noted (and if so noted, they would not be first editions).  A signed book is just that, while an inscribed book is dedicated to a particular person.  We accept all the usual credit cards as well as checks & money orders in U.S. funds.  American libraries may submit purchase orders.  Full postage & packing charges are added to such invoiced orders.  Georgia residents please add 8 percent sales tax.  We make every effort to delete books promptly from the data base, but books are subject to prior sale.   Books purchased one at a time are net to all.  

We try to quote conservatively using the late AB Bookman's Weekly guidelines for the antiquarian book trade, in effect from 1948.  For example, Fine (F) is almost as good as new without being crisp, Very Good (VG) can show some small signs of wear, Good (G) is the average used or slightly worn book with all pages present.  ""Fine"" is our highest grading.  At the lowest end of the scale is a ""reading copy,  which is textually complete only.  A ""binding copy"" is in need of professional rebinding or other extensive repair.  Various descriptions such as near Fine (nrF), near Very Good (nrVG) and Good plus (G+) are efforts to tweak a subjective process of description.   ""About Good"" is less than ""Good,"" marginally above ""fair.   We try to note all serious flaws, but please remember that too detailed descriptions can often make a book seem less desirable than it is in reality.  For overseas customers, please note that shipping rates have skyrocketed, but if you are interested in a particular book, send us an email and we will direct you to a shipping consolidator who may be able to ship more cheaply.

Bookman Books started as excess inventory of a book scout being sold on Ebay. From there it grew into a small, overstuffed, brick-and-mortar store in Suffolk, Virginia with an inventory of 100,000+ books. With a change of ownership, we originally joined AbeBooks back in 1998. Then there was a relocation to another brick-and-mortar store in Lynchburg, Virginia where we continued to grow.

Because of a change in the business environment, we had to change as well in order to survive. We currently operate as internet based only, with an uncatalogued inventory of approximately 30,000 books. They are all slowly making their way online for you.

          48855",,17:03:1998,5,"....It  can be very difficult to tell if a book is a BOOK CLUB EDITION (BCE). It often does not say at all on the book that it is.  Nowadays book club editions are often of the same quality in regards to paper, binding, covers, ink, illustrations and plates etc...as standard trade editions. Sometimes there is a little indentation on the rear cover at the bottom near the spine but not always. Sometimes there is no price on the dustjacket but then many publishers issue trade editions with no price on the jacket, being kind enough to let the bookdealer decide what to charge for a book....so how can you tell? It's hard sometimes...When you acquire the book second hand, how are you supposed to know ?  If I think a book might be a book club edition I mention it just to be safe....
These are some of the ABBREVIATIONS you may find in my book descriptions :
 sd=same date=same date is on the title page and the copyright page, used to identify first printings of first editions. nap=no additional printings =no additional printings indicated, used to identify first printings of first editions. I check the books out using McBride's Guide To First Editions and Zempel & Verkers First Editions, A Guide...that is where the terminology comes from.  dw=dust wrapper. (dust jacket). 12mo= small book (approx. 4"" 8vo= average book size(6x lO"" approx.) 4to=larger size book (12xlO""approx.). folio = giant size (over 12"" ta11) book. t.e.g.= top edge gilt. a.e.g= all edges gilt. dec.= decorative. illus.=illustrated. cl.=clothbound.wraps= paperback.(a trade paperback is a large expensive paperback, also known as a Quality paperback; a massmarket paperback is the smaller variety) drknd=darkened.t.pg.=title page. flyl.=flyleaf (blank pages at front and back of book) glt.gilt (gold ink used in printing) cov.=cover. frontis.=frontispiece(plate or illus. facing t.pg.) ex lib.= ex-library (book has library markings stamps,numbers, etc.... sl.=slight (ly) sp.=spine. n.d.= no date. repr.= reprint .chron.=chronology. append.=appendix. tr.=translated. 1st ed.=first edition. pr.=printing. e.p.=endpapers(the paper on the inside of the cover ).emb.=embossed. biblio.= bibliography. b&w.=black &white.BCE= book club edition.obl.=oblong (book is wider than it is tall)

These are the guidelines I use to describe the CONDITION of a book.
VF= Very Fine= mint condition. clean, bright, as new.like new.  /Fine=Ex.=Excellent;clean but not quite new.  almost new.  /VG+=near fine= almost perfect but may have bookplate, previous owner's signature, etc... may have minor smudges, soiling, spots. VG=Very Good, book may be soiled , marked. edges may be rubbed.still sound. may have underlining or highlighting but it will be noted in the description. /Good=hinge trouble,shabbiness,tears.'reading copy'./Fair= book isn't completely falling apart but you'd better be careful reading it./Poor=book is a complete wreck (looks like it was shot out of a cannon )and may be missing pages or illustrations or have other major defects which will be noted.

Books are generally priced for domestic USA standard SHIPPING. International and priority shipping can often cost extra if the item  is very large, or heavy or is a set of more than one book. Shipping costs are impossible to predict for every order and destination.

          Colebrook, CT, U.S.A.
          06021",,01:10:2004,5,"The Colebrook Book Barn was established in 1955 at its present location in Colebrook, Connecticut in the northwestern corner of the state, about 3 miles from the Massachusetts border.  We are approximately one hour from Hartford, an hour and a half from New Haven, an hour from Waterbury and 30 minutes from Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and the Berkshires, and 2 ½ hours from both New York City and Boston.

Our Book Barn, built in the early 1800 s, still has its original beams and wide floor-boards, and large sliding door in the front.  We have a general stock of approximately 15,000 volumes with most subjects represented. We also have a large selection of scarce and rare books which may be seen on request.  These books include Fine Bindings, Americana, First Editions, Early American Printing, Maps and Atlases, pamphlets and broadsides, and an occasional print or original work of art.  We exhibit at 25 shows a year, including Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, St. Petersburg, Florida, Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles and others.  
  
Because the Book Barn is not heated we are by necessity closed in the winter, usually from mid November to mid March, however if we are available we do allow browsing in the winter months by appointment only. In the summer we are open by chance or appointment, it s best to call ahead. 
   
We are always interested in buying large or small collections of good books, including rare or unusual items on any subject, and also maps, posters, pamphlets and ephemera. 

We are members of The Antiquarian Booksellers  Association of America (ABAA); The International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB); The Ephemera Society of America; and we are listed in The Connecticut Antiquarian Booksellers  Directory.

Celebrating over 50 years of supporting the Humboldt County Library System --
Purpose:
-To stimulate interest in the needs, services and facilities of the Redwood Libraries. 
-To raise funds to enable the Libraries to procure books, and other materials, and to meet other library needs not provided for in the regular budget.

Fund Raising:
Our most important work is raising funds for the Libraries through ongoing sales in our Serendipity Bookstore, over the Internet at Abebooks.com, Amazon.com, and Alibris.com and through our quarterly Book Sales. These activities are generously supported by Friends members and the general public and provide the Libraries with funds that are urgently needed in these times of severe budget shortages.
 Volunteers Needed:
Volunteers are the very lifeblood of the Friends organization. Many are needed to help with the unpacking and sorting of donated books. Most of this activity takes place on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. We need your help when we set up for our Book Sales. The more hands to help, the faster the setup and the lighter the work for all. We also have occasional openings for regular shifts in the Bookstore. Please call us at 707-269-1995 if you can help with any of these activities.

A thorough understanding of classical languages (particularly Latin) and of the main languages of Western culture (Italian, English, French, Spanish and German) allows us to deal with a wide range of books and to access the scientific publications printed in these languages.
Fabrizio has also deepened his knowledge in the field of antiquarian books, attending courses at the École de l'Institut d'Histoire du Livre of Lyon, concerning textual and physical bibliography and printing types, and at Merton College in Oxford on the study of paper.
Fabrizio has been for several years committee member and treasurer of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Italy (ALAI) and, from 2010 to 2015, its president. From 2016 to 2019 he has served as committee member and vice-president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB).
The main aim of our activity is to propose rare and never trivial works in all fields of human knowledge from the beginning of writing to the present day; works that do not necessarily represent milestones in the history of humanity, but that simply express the genuine and original fruit of human ingenuity.
In an era in which the digital has taken over the paper, we believe it is of great importance for the research and for the preservation to posterity of our history to have access to the primary sources, that is to say to the texts in their original editions. The physical aspect of the manuscripts and printed editions that have transmitted to us the texts in their original, is not a secondary detail, but represents a fundamental element for the understanding of the texts themselves and for the history of their reception and influence. For this reason, in addition to attaching great importance to the choice of the edition of the works we offer for sale, it is our constant concern to present those editions in the best and most genuine copies that can be found on the market.
It is also essential for us to carry out a thorough search of the provenance of the volumes on offer. To this end, we actively cooperate not only with the authorities responsible for carrying out the necessary checks and issuing the mandatory licenses, but also with the cultural institutions in which many of our books, at the end of all our research, find a definitive and prestigious home.
The aim of our research lies not only in finding forgotten works that are brought back to the attention of scholars and collectors, but also in the active participation in the  chain  of the ancient and rare book, which in addition to antiquarian booksellers sees as fundamental operators libraries, auction houses and collectors.",73599605,https://www.abebooks.com/govi-rare-books-llc-new-york/73599605/sf,https://pictures.abebooks.com/storefront/73599605/VendorStoreFront.jpg,{'Ars Epistolica_Govi Rare Books LLC': 'https://d18d761r9motu7.cloudfront.net/cc-sprites/7ZBBnzeFZ6Bsf6LW3TbFgt.png'}
